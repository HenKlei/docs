.. py:class:: BaseNeuralNetworkModel(dim_input=0, products=None, error_estimator=None, visualizer=None, name=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pymor.models.interface.Model`

   Base class for models that use artificial neural networks.

   This class implements the scaling methods for inputs and outputs/targets of
   neural networks.

   .. py:method:: _scale_input(self, i)


   .. py:method:: _scale_target(self, i)



.. py:class:: NeuralNetworkModel(neural_network, parameters={}, scaling_parameters={}, output_functional=None, products=None, error_estimator=None, visualizer=None, name=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseNeuralNetworkModel`

   Class for models of stationary problems that use artificial neural networks.

   This class implements a |Model| that uses a neural network for solving.

   .. admonition:: Parameters

       neural_network
           The neural network that approximates the mapping from parameter space
           to solution space. Should be an instance of
           :class:`~pymor.models.neural_network.FullyConnectedNN` with input size that
           matches the (total) number of parameters and output size equal to the
           dimension of the reduced space.
       parameters
           |Parameters| of the reduced order model (the same as used in the full-order
           model).
       scaling_parameters
           Dict of tensors that determine how to scale inputs before passing them
           through the neural network and outputs after obtaining them from the
           neural network. If not provided or each entry is `None`, no scaling is
           applied. Required keys are `'min_inputs'`, `'max_inputs'`, `'min_targets'`,
           and `'max_targets'`.
       output_functional
           |Operator| mapping a given solution to the model output. In many applications,
           this will be a |Functional|, i.e. an |Operator| mapping to scalars.
           This is not required, however.
       products
           A dict of inner product |Operators| defined on the discrete space the
           problem is posed on. For each product with key `'x'` a corresponding
           attribute `x_product`, as well as a norm method `x_norm` is added to
           the model.
       error_estimator
           An error estimator for the problem. This can be any object with
           an `estimate_error(U, mu, m)` method. If `error_estimator` is
           not `None`, an `estimate_error(U, mu)` method is added to the
           model which will call `error_estimator.estimate_error(U, mu, self)`.
       visualizer
           A visualizer for the problem. This can be any object with
           a `visualize(U, m, ...)` method. If `visualizer`
           is not `None`, a `visualize(U, *args, **kwargs)` method is added
           to the model which forwards its arguments to the
           visualizer's `visualize` method.
       name
           Name of the model.
           
   .. py:method:: _compute_solution(self, mu=None, **kwargs)

      Compute the model's solution for |parameter values| `mu`.

      This method is called by the default implementation of :meth:`compute`
      in :class:`pymor.models.interface.Model`.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          mu
              |Parameter values| for which to compute the solution.
          kwargs
              Additional keyword arguments to customize how the solution is
              computed or to select additional data to be returned.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          |VectorArray| with the computed solution or a dict which at least
          must contain the key `'solution'`.
