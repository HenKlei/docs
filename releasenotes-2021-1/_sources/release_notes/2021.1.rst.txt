pyMOR 2021.1 (September 30, 2021)
---------------------------------
We are proud to announce the release of pyMOR 2021.1! This release includes
several new reductors for LTI systems. In particular, methods for reducing and
analysing unstable systems have been added. ANNs can now be used in order to
directly approximate output qunatities. Furthermore, it is now possible to
work with time-dependent parameters in pyMOR.

Over ??? single commits have entered this release. For a full list of changes

pyMOR 2021.1 contains contributions by Tim Keil, Hendrik Kleikamp and Meret
Behrens. See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/AUTHORS.md>`__ for

Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods for unstable LTI systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many popular system-theoretic model order reduction methods are not applicable
to unstable LTI systems out of the box. In
`[#1149] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1149>`_ two reductors and several
methods for working with and analyzing unstable |LTIModels| have been added.
The :class:`~pymor.reductors.bt.FDBTReductor` allows for applying the balanced
truncation technique to unstable systems by performing a Bernoulli stabiliztion
before the using the classical BT method. The :class:`~pymor.reductors.h2.GapIRKAReductor`
aims to compute a reduced-order model such that the approximation error with
respect to the :math:`\mathcal{H}_2`-Gap norm is small. Additionally,
a variety of numerical linear algebra methods have been a part of
`[#1149] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1149>`_: Riccati equation solvers
for small and dense matrices, Bernoulli matrix equation solver, new options for
for pyMORs eigensolver such as shift-and-invert mode and :math:`\mathcal{L}_2`-norm
computation for |LTIModels|. The new methods and reductors are showcased in
:doc:`../tutorial_unstable_lti_systems`.
