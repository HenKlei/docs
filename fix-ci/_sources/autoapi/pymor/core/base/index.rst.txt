:mod:`pymor.core.base`
======================

.. py:module:: pymor.core.base

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module provides base classes from which most classes in pyMOR inherit.

   The purpose of these classes is to provide some common functionality for
   all objects in pyMOR. The most notable features provided by :class:`BasicObject`
   are the following:

       1. :class:`BasicObject` sets class :class:`UberMeta` as metaclass
          which itself inherits from :class:`abc.ABCMeta`. Thus it is possible
          to define interface classes with abstract methods using the
          :func:`abstractmethod` decorator. There are also decorators for
          abstract class methods, static methods, and properties.
       2. Using metaclass magic, each *class* deriving from :class:`BasicObject`
          comes with its own :mod:`~pymor.core.logger` instance accessible through its `logger`
          attribute. The logger prefix is automatically set to the class name.
       3. Logging can be disabled and re-enabled for each *instance* using the
          :meth:`BasicObject.disable_logging` and :meth:`BasicObject.enable_logging`
          methods.
       4. :meth:`BasicObject.uid` provides a unique id for each instance. While
          `id(obj)` is only guaranteed to be unique among all living Python objects,
          :meth:`BasicObject.uid` will be (almost) unique among all pyMOR objects
          that have ever existed, including previous runs of the application. This
          is achieved by building the id from a uuid4 which is newly created for
          each pyMOR run and a counter which is increased for any object that requests
          an uid.
       5. If not set by the user to another value, :attr:`BasicObject.name` is
          set to the name of the object's class.


   :class:`ImmutableObject` derives from :class:`BasicObject` and adds the following
   functionality:

       1. Using more metaclass magic, each instance which derives from
          :class:`ImmutableObject` is locked after its `__init__` method has returned.
          Each attempt to change one of its attributes raises an exception. Private
          attributes (of the form `_name`) are exempted from this rule.
       2. :meth:`ImmutableObject.with_` can be used to create a copy of an instance with
          some changed attributes. E.g. ::

              obj.with_(a=x, b=y)

          creates a copy with the `a` and `b` attributes of `obj` set to `x` and `y`.
          `with_` is implemented by creating a new instance, passing the arguments of
          `with_` to `__init__`. The missing `__init__` arguments are taken from instance
          attributes of the same name.

.. py:class:: UID

   Provides unique, quickly computed ids by combining a session UUID4 with a counter.

   .. py:attribute:: __slots__
      :annotation: = ['uid']

.. py:class:: UberMeta(cls, name, bases, namespace)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABCMeta`

   Metaclass for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

   Use this metaclass to create an ABC.  An ABC can be subclassed
   directly, and then acts as a mix-in class.  You can also register
   unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated
   ABCs as 'virtual subclasses' -- these and their descendants will
   be considered subclasses of the registering ABC by the built-in
   issubclass() function, but the registering ABC won't show up in
   their MRO (Method Resolution Order) nor will method
   implementations defined by the registering ABC be callable (not
   even via super()).


.. py:class:: BasicObject

   Base class for most classes in pyMOR.

   .. attribute:: logger

      A per-class instance of :class:`logging.Logger` with the class
      name as prefix.

   .. attribute:: logging_disabled

      `True` if logging has been disabled.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the instance. If not set by the user, the name is
      set to the class name.

   .. attribute:: uid

      A unique id for each instance. The uid is obtained by using
      :class:`UID` and is unique for all pyMOR objects ever created.
      

   .. py:attribute:: _uid
      

      

   .. py:method:: disable_logging(self, doit=True)

      Disable logging output for this instance.


   .. py:method:: enable_logging(self, doit=True)

      Enable logging output for this instance.


   .. py:method:: _format_repr(self, max_width, verbosity, override={})


   .. py:method:: __repr__(self)

.. py:class:: ImmutableMeta(cls, name, bases, namespace)

   Bases: :py:obj:`UberMeta`

   Metaclass for :class:`ImmutableObject`.

   .. py:attribute:: __call__
      

      

   .. py:method:: _call(self, *args, **kwargs)



.. py:class:: ImmutableObject

   Bases: :py:obj:`BasicObject`

   Base class for immutable objects in pyMOR.

   Instances of `ImmutableObject` are immutable in the sense that
   after execution of `__init__`, any modification of a non-private
   attribute will raise an exception.

   .. _ImmutableObjectWarning:
   .. warning::
          For instances of `ImmutableObject`,
          the result of member function calls should be completely
          determined by the function's arguments together with the
          object's `__init__` arguments and the current state of pyMOR's
          global |defaults|.

   While, in principle, you are allowed to modify private members after
   instance initialization, this should never affect the outcome of
   future method calls. In particular, if you update any internal state
   after initialization, you have to ensure that this state is not affected
   by possible changes of the global :mod:`~pymor.core.defaults`.

   .. py:attribute:: _locked
      :annotation: = False

      

   .. py:method:: __setattr__(self, key, value)

      Depending on _locked state I delegate the setattr call to object or
      raise an Exception.


   .. py:method:: with_(self, new_type=None, **kwargs)

      Returns a copy with changed attributes.

      A a new class instance is created with the given keyword arguments as
      arguments for `__init__`.  Missing arguments are obtained form instance
      attributes with the
      same name.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          new_type
              If not None, return an instance of this class (instead of `type(self)`).
          `**kwargs`
              Names of attributes to change with their new values. Each attribute name
              has to be an argument to `__init__`.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          Copy of `self` with changed attributes.
              


   .. py:method:: __copy__(self)


   .. py:method:: __deepcopy__(self, memo)
